## THE INSTACART RESTAURANT DELIVERY CLONE

<img width="100%" src='instaplate.png'>

Have you ever wondered what it would look like if Instacart got into the restaurant delivery business, while simultaneously ripping off UberEats's UI? Look no further, my friends.

Instaplate is a full-stack demo web app where you can:

- Browse, sort, search, and filter restaurants
- Browse and search dishes
- Add, remove, and adjust the quantity of dishes to your shopping cart
- Checkout using Stripe's test card credentials
- Register and login using email or your Google account

The front end is built with React and Typescript, and uses minimal libraries to achieve complex CSS animations that interact with state, such as the menu/login/register drawer opening and closing behavior.

See it in action at [instaplate.herokuapp.com](http://instaplate.herokuapp.com)!
